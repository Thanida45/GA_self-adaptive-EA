# Mini Project: Evaluating Unique Input Output (UIO) Sequences for Conformance Testing of Finite State Machines (FSMs) using Evolutionary Algorithms


## Abstract

Finite State Machine (FSM) is an essential computation model for Software Engineering system. However, there is a problem in finite state machines. The computation of unique input output (UIO) sequences of finite state machines is a problem in Software Testing area. In previous research, Evolutionary Algorithms are effective and therefore recommended to compute unique input output (UIO) sequences of finite state machines in conformance testing. The aim of this project is to observe two kinds of Evolutionary Algorithms which are applied to compute unique input output (UIO) sequences for conformance testing of finite state machines: The Genetic Algorithm (GA), and the Self-Adaptive Evolutionary Algorithm (Self- Adaptive EA). This project presents how to design a finite state machine, how to compute unique input output (UIO) sequences, how algorithms work, and which algorithms have done better. The results of both algorithms are observed from the empirical study in the experiments. Such results are compared and analysed the performance of computing unique input output (UIO) sequences. In practical, the performance on computing UIOs of finite state machines of the Self-Adaptive EA is better than the GAâ€™ performance when considering the same finite state machines. The limitation on computing UIOs of both programs refers to the number of states of the finite state machines, input/output of each state and complicated transitions.

## Search Strategy and Material Supports

### Forms of literature to be retrieved.
There are particular words for searching, e.g. unique input output (UIO) sequences, conformance testing of finite state machines, Evolutionary Algorithms and software testing. The length of date for searching previous research is between 1992 and 2018 for looking at various solutions with different periods. All the previous research, which is based on English language, has been retrieved on the online search tools such as google scholar, semantic scholar and others. Fourteen papers of the previous research have been reviewed in this project.

### A tool of references
Zotero is a software managing short citations and bibliography and can be applied to Microsoft Word. Basically, this software can collect all articles for this project. A style of all references which is used in this project is in the American Psychological Association referencing style. The short citations are applied in all chapters except the references chapter where the long citation or the bibliography is only applied.

### A tool for programming
Netbeans 8.1 is a software programming the Genetic Algorithm and Self-Adaptive Evolutionary Algorithm for finding unique input output (UIO) sequence of finite state machines. Both algorithms are programmed as an application by using JAVA Language. The programs may be implemented following the algorithms and referring to the problem on computing unique input output (UIO) sequence and the fitness function for the solution. The programs of this project will be on CD on the last page following the Guidance of the second mini-project on Canvas.

### A tool for analysis
In this project, R application is a testing system for analysing the difference of the results of two programs. R application can provide the p-values which present the difference of the results. This application is useful for analysis two sample, in which refer to the GA and the Self-Adaptive EA in this project.
